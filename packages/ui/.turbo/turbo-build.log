Entry module "index.ts" is using named and default exports together. Consumers of your bundle will have to use `ui.default` to access the default export, which may not be what you want. Use `output.exports: "named"` to disable this warning.
No name was provided for external module "vue" in "output.globals" – guessing "vue".
